## if-else

Aim: To study and implement C++ decision making statements.

Theory:Decision-making statements in C++ are essential for controlling the flow of a program based on certain conditions. These statements evaluate conditions and execute specific code blocks depending on whether the conditions are true or false. The primary decision-making statements in C++ include if, else if, else, switch, and conditional (ternary) operators. The if statement allows for executing a block of code if a condition is true, and can be extended with else if and else for multiple conditions. The switch statement provides a way to execute different code blocks based on the value of a variable, making it a suitable choice for situations with multiple possible discrete values. The conditional operator ?: offers a compact syntax for simple if-else conditions. These decision-making constructs enable developers to create dynamic and responsive programs that can adapt to varying inputs and scenarios, forming the backbone of logic control in software applications

1. To print a pattern

Start

Input:

Prompt the user to enter an integer n.

Read the integer n from the user.

Generate Pattern:

Loop: For each i from 1 to n (where i represents the current row number):

Nested Loop: For each j from 1 to i (where j represents the number of stars in the current row):

Print "* " (a star followed by a space).

Print a newline to move to the next row.

End

2. To print even numbers from 1 to 20

 Start
 
For each integer i from 0 to 10 (inclusive):

If i is even (i.e., i % 2 == 0):

Print i followed by a newline

End
