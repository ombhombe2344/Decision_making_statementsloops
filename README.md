Aim-To study and implement C++ decision making statement loops

Theory-In programming, decision-making statements and loops are fundamental constructs that enable developers to control the flow of execution within a program. They allow for the creation of dynamic and responsive software that can adapt to varying conditions and perform repeated tasks efficiently. Loops, such as for, while, and do-while, allow a block of code to be executed repeatedly until a specified condition is met. The for loop is ideal for iterating a known number of times, often used when working with arrays or collections. The while loop checks the condition before each iteration and is useful when the number of iterations is not predetermined. The do-while loop ensures the code block is executed at least once, as the condition is evaluated after the loop's body
# algorithm

1. To print a pattern

Start

Input:

Prompt the user to enter an integer n.

Read the integer n from the user.

Generate Pattern:

Loop: For each i from 1 to n (where i represents the current row number):

Nested Loop: For each j from 1 to i (where j represents the number of stars in the current row):

Print "* " (a star followed by a space).

Print a newline to move to the next row.

End

2. To print even numbers from 1 to 20

 Start
 
For each integer i from 0 to 10 (inclusive):

If i is even (i.e., i % 2 == 0):

Print i followed by a newline

End

3. Password checker
4. 
Start the program.

Set the correct password to 2344.

Prompt the user to enter a password.

Read the user's input password.

Check if the entered password matches the correct password:

If the passwords do not match:

Display "Incorrect Password."

Prompt the user to enter the password again.

Read the new password input.

Repeat the check until the entered password matches the correct password.

If the passwords match:

Display "System is Unlocked."

End the loop and the program.

End the program.
