## if-else

Aim: To study and implement C++ decision making statements.

Theory:Decision-making statements in C++ are essential for controlling the flow of a program based on certain conditions. These statements evaluate conditions and execute specific code blocks depending on whether the conditions are true or false. The primary decision-making statements in C++ include if, else if, else, switch, and conditional (ternary) operators. The if statement allows for executing a block of code if a condition is true, and can be extended with else if and else for multiple conditions. The switch statement provides a way to execute different code blocks based on the value of a variable, making it a suitable choice for situations with multiple possible discrete values. The conditional operator ?: offers a compact syntax for simple if-else conditions. These decision-making constructs enable developers to create dynamic and responsive programs that can adapt to varying inputs and scenarios, forming the backbone of logic control in software applications
# algorithm

1. To print a pattern

Start

Input:

Prompt the user to enter an integer n.

Read the integer n from the user.

Generate Pattern:

Loop: For each i from 1 to n (where i represents the current row number):

Nested Loop: For each j from 1 to i (where j represents the number of stars in the current row):

Print "* " (a star followed by a space).

Print a newline to move to the next row.

End

2. To print even numbers from 1 to 20

 Start
 
For each integer i from 0 to 10 (inclusive):

If i is even (i.e., i % 2 == 0):

Print i followed by a newline

End

3. Password checker
4. 
Start the program.

Set the correct password to 2344.

Prompt the user to enter a password.

Read the user's input password.

Check if the entered password matches the correct password:

If the passwords do not match:

Display "Incorrect Password."

Prompt the user to enter the password again.

Read the new password input.

Repeat the check until the entered password matches the correct password.

If the passwords match:

Display "System is Unlocked."

End the loop and the program.

End the program.
